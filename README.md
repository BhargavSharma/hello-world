# hello-world
My first repository

README files usually give information about the whole project. Since this is the hello-world repository, it is pretty obvious that this is the first repository that i'm creating and working on. 

Hi, I am Bhargav. I'm beginning to use github today. This is my first repository and first readme file. After adding the preceding text and the following text, i will be performing my first 'conscious' commit. :) 

Cheers!!
